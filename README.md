## Features

LiveRider provide a better more colorful yet controlled/tamed color scheme with a theme of blue, green and pink inspired by Jetbrains Rider to help you focus on the code and not get distraced by too flashy color differences.

- Rich in color (by rich I meant I slapped blue, green, and pink-purple everything)
- Less white, operators, keywords are not plain text
- Does not change the default VSCode background color
- Does not hurt your eyes with too bright or too much constrast colors
- Works for languages such as Typescript, Javascript, Elixir, Go and Python

## Language support

- Typescript
- Javascript
- JSX
- Elixir
- Go
- Python

... more coming soon, maybe.

## Why this exist?

There aren't many people who uses Rider Theme especially in vscode which make sense, but I like it so I am going to make an extension.

There is a Rider Extension already but, I don't like the color option especially when working with React, Go and Elixir Files
Obviously, I could have gone with any other theme but come on. I don't personally like having many tokens colored like plain text
as it is hard o read and scan through.

`dark-plus-syntax`, is actually my goto but although I don't hate the default color scheme, I prefer Rider's.

Thus, here we are

Obviously, this will never even exised if Jetbrains never created the Rider theme, so credit where credit is due. Thanks Jetbrains and Thanks VSCode for allowing me to publish this extension.
