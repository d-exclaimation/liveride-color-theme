# LiveRider Color Theme

LiveRider Color Theme is Rider-Insipired Color Theme from Jetbrains.

## Why this exist?

There aren't many people who uses Rider Theme especially in vscode which make sense, but I like it so I am going to make an extension

There is a Rider Extension already but, I don't like the color option especially when working with React, Go and Elixir Files
Obviously, I could have gone with any other theme but come on.

`dark-plus-syntax`, is actually my goto but although I don't hate the default color scheme, I prefer Rider's

Thus, here we are

Additional points:

- Rich in color (by rich I meant I slapped blue, green, and pink-purple everything)
- Less white, operators, keywords are not plain text
- Does not change the default VSCode background color
- Does not hurt your eyes with too bright or too much constrast
- Works for languages such as Typescript, Javascript, Elixir, maybe Go (I have checked every edge cases)

## Language support

- Typescript
- Javascript
- JSX
- Elixir

... more coming soon, maybe

Obviously, this will never even exised if Jetbrains never created the Rider theme, so credit where credit is due
